# CMSFD (Content Manager for Developers)
I used Content Managers, and realized they are less oriented in programming. Thus, I made this. There's more programming involved, and should be more flexibile.

## Tradeoff
- Since contents and behaviors are being programmed by admins, the security of the software is heavily based off their ability to write secure code.
- An average user may have a harder time using this software due to the necessary knowledge of programming
